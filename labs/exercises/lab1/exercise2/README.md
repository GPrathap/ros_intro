# Exercise 2: C++ & CMake recap

## Goal:

* Recap on the concepts of include and some C++ basics
* Understand how CMake works



## Steps:

* Create a library that includes a header file that contains definition of two function add, sub (add and subtract two numbers, respectively)
* Create a source file that implements these two functions
* Create a main file that calls this library functions
* Create a Cmake file that build them
* Build them



## Questions?
* Did you understand how CMake works?
* Try to add more files, change names and make it build correctly!
* Why do we need a build directory?
* What is the difference between CMake and make?

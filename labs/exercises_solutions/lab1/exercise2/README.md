# Exercise 2: C++ & CMake recap

## Solution

* Create src and lib directories
* src will have the main source running code
* lib will have the libraries source codes and it will have include and src directories (has the headers and implementation codes, respectively)
* Do not forget about CMakeLists files to link and include the source codes.
